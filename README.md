# Hack Sprint T2

## NAME
Hack Sprint t2

## TECHNOLOGIES UTILIZED
Godot
Python

## DESCRIPTION
For our Hack Sprint, Logan, Josh and I decided to create a game. This game would be classified in the gaming world as an endless runner.
The inspiration for our game came from Dino Game, an endless runner created by Google to entertain users when they are without an
internet connection in browsers developed by google. Also like Dino Game, we want our player character to avoid certain obstacles in the path and to continue until failure with a score system increasing as the player character survives only ending after failure. We also
plan on incorporating a difficulty scale that will increase after prologned survival. We are familiarizing ourselves with Godot
and GodotScript which is slightly similar to python in order to design and construct the game.

## HOW TO PLAY
The Game is going to be designed with ease of use in mind. There will be a main menu that can be accessed in any browser that will allow you
to play the game or exit. One of our stretch goals is to include a high scores page.
